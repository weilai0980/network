<p align="CENTER">PARTIAL CORRELATION</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What it does:</p>
<p>It measures the linear relationship between two interval/ratio scale variables controlling for (holding constant) a third interval/ratio scale variable. One way of thinking about the partial correlation coefficient is this: suppose you calculate the bivariate correlation coefficient for each value of the control variable and you calculate some sort of a weighted average of these bivariate correlation coefficients. </p>
<p>Words of caution:</p>
<p>1. Unlike in tabular analysis, here you end up with a single number (and not as many as categories the control variable has). As a result, partial correlation is not a good way of detecting specification (statistical interaction). </p>
<p>2. In the world of correlation (bivariate or partial) all relationships are assumed to be linear including the relationship between the original variables and the control variable.</p>
<p>3. The partial correlation is symmetric only with respect to the original two variables. The partial correlation between y and x controlling for t is the same as the partial correlation between x and y controlling for t. But the partial correlation between y and x controlling for t is not the same as the partial correlation between y and t controlling for x, or between x and t controlling for y.</p>

<p>Where <i><font size="5">r<sub>yx.t </sub></font></i>= 	the (first-order) partial correlation of y and x controlling for t</p>
<p>	<i><font size="5">r<sub>yx</sub></font></i><font size="5"> </font>= the bivariate (zero-order) correlation of y and x</p>
<p>	<i><font size="5">r<sub>yt</sub></font></i> =	the bivariate (zero-order) correlation of y and t</p>
<i><font size="5"></font></i><font size="5"></font><p><font size="5"><i>r<sub>xt </sub></i></font>=	the bivariate (zero-order) correlation of x and t</p>
<p>The formula suggests that the partial correlation is the function of the bivariate correlations among the three variables. </p>
<p>The partial correlation can be generalized to situations where you control for more than one variable. As a result, we distinguish between first-order partial correlation (controlling for a single variable), second-order partial correlation (controlling for two) and so on. In this class we only cover first order partial correlations.</p>
